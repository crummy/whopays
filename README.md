WhoPays?
=======
You're at lunch with friends, and the bill arrives. You share a Splitwise group, but given the complex web of debts, and the fact that not all of you are present, it can be difficult to figure out who owes the most within this subset of friends.

Enter WhoPays?. Simple choose who is present, and immediately see whose turn it is to pay the bill.
